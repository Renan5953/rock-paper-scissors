# rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple project created as part of [The Odin Project] course.

## About the Project

The current version of the script contains basic logic for playing a rock-paper-scissors game via the console, including obtaining the player and computer choices, a simple comparison system, score tracking, and displaying messages for each possible outcome.

## How to Play

The script runs automatically when the page loads, prompting the user five times to enter their choice ('rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'). The results of the match are then displayed in the browser's DevTools console.
