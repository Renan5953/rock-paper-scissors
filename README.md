# rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) course.

## About the Project

The current version features the core logic for a rock-paper-scissors game, including obtaining the player and computer choices, comparing results, tracking scores, and displaying messages for each possible outcome.
It also includes a responsive UI that updates dynamically based on each round and the final match result.

## How to Play

When the page loads, the user is prompted to enter their name. This name is then displayed in the scoreboard.

After that, the player can choose between the three available options ('rock', 'paper', or 'scissors') by clicking the buttons on the left side of the screen. After each selection, the block below the buttons will display the result of the round.

When either the player or the computer reaches five points, the match ends automatically, and the winner is shown just below the scoreboard on the right side.
If the player selects an option again after the match has ended, the scores reset to zero and a new match begins.
